 <?php echo '<p>Hello there! My name is Lorin and I live in Idaho Falls. 
 I am majoring in Web Design and Development with an emphasis in Web Development, 
 and will have my Bachelors degree in just 2 more semesters (after this one)!!
 I served my mission in Milan Italy, and promised my wife I would take her there one day, 
 so any donations to that cause would be greatly appreciated. We will be married for 4 years this upcoming November.
  We have a beautiful, fun-loving, super energetic 2 year old daughter, and are expecting another addition to our
   family at the end of December! My special talents include: making awesome blanket forts, building super 
   tall lego towers, and coloring with crayons. I love doing anything with my family, 
and I enjoy swimming in my spare time. (hah! Spare time, that was nice once upon a time.)</p>'; ?>
